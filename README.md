# StarrySky
A platformer game, written in C++11, using GLFW.
GL/Texture.h, GL/TextureAtlas.h, and GL/TextureAtlas.cpp are originally from github.com/ricanteja/Moony-SpriteBatch, but were rewritten for Starry Sky.
The original engine for Starry Sky was based off of github.com/pixelpicosean/PlatformerEngine, but they were also rewritten.
