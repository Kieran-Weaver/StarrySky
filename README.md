# StarrySky
A platformer game, written in C++11, using GLFW.

GL/Texture.h, GL/TextureAtlas.h, and GL/TextureAtlas.cpp are originally from https://github.com/ricanteja/Moony-SpriteBatch, but were rewritten for Starry Sky.

The original engine for Starry Sky was based off of https://github.com/pixelpicosean/PlatformerEngine, but they were also rewritten.

The engine uses texture atlases which are generated by https://github.com/ChevyRay/crunch, and then recompressed by recrunch
